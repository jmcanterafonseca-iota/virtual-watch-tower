# Participant onboarding instructions

## Generate a new IOTA Identity linked to a public certificate

### Create and register a new IOTA Identity

First

```sh
git clone -b stardust https://github.com/iotaledger/tangle.js
cd tangle.js/examples-stardust
npm install
npm run dist
```

then a `.env` file has to be prepared similar to (and written to the `examples-stardust` folder)

```sh
NODE_ENDPOINT="https://api.stable.iota-ec.net"
PLUGIN_ENDPOINT="${NODE_ENDPOINT}/api/ext/v1"
TOKEN="eyJâ€¦"
```

To generate a new IOTA Identity the following instruction has to be executed:

```sh
node --loader=extensionless ./es/identity/createDIDWithJWKFundedByPluginEd25519Subtle.js "https://jmcanterafonseca-iota.github.io/virtual-watch-tower/public/certs/vwt-1.crt"
```

The URL specified must be the URL that will host the certificate associated with the Verification method added to the DID document. The certificate will be signed by a CA (for instance Let's Encrypt) or a testing CA, like the ones that can be created with [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).

With that instruction a new IOTA Identity will be generated together with a Verification Method (bound to the corresponding DID document) that will be used to sign documents, etc. 

It is recommended to resolve the DID through the INX Identity plugin so that it is checked the confirmation of the transaction in the IOTA Ledger:

```sh
curl --location 'https://api.stable.iota-ec.net/api/ext/v1/identities/did:iota:ebsi:0x74e4ac1abc064b3fea1feb08dde20220418c4abdb478738075b869100143e408' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJ...' \
```

### Prepare the different assets

The JSON snippet at the end of the command line result, above ex. 

```json
{
  "did": "did:iota:ebsi:0x74e4ac1abc064b3fea1feb08dde20220418c4abdb478738075b869100143e408",
  "privateKeyDidControl": "0x5e239050f0d5129a245e731703f9dc397d8ee2716152a79741989fb68152b68244b32f5745c7b00a4bbf03acb73eca726e01bdf7f8ba43c31c711e32af0dfd98",

}
```

has to be saved as this will be a file containing identity details that will be used later. During this tutorial guide we will name this file `identity.json`. An example can be found [here](./identities/vwt-1.json).

Additionally the output of the script above will contain the public key and the private key of the Verification method in PEM format. This is needed for OpenSSL in order to generate the corresponding certificate. For instance,

```text
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MC4CAQAwBQYDK2VwBCIEINHeePH7mXYrNdWuM1v2E0HwbZZpS0BGQEZAVoSGo5Cj
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

```text
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MCowBQYDK2VwAyEALS5i7/UP11u+Hx6V6IMMesMXhwcM1XfhQ56LlwCovXM=
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

### Generate a new certificate for the Identity's Verification Method

First of all a new CSR has to be generated using:

```sh
openssl req -new -key ./identity-dataset/pem-keys/vwt-1.example.org-key.pem -out req.pem
```

After executing this instruction, and filling all the CSR fields required, a new CSR `req.pem` will be created. Now the certificate has to be generated, signed by our CA. In this example we are going to use the mkcert CA, so the certificate is finally generated as follows:

```sh
mkcert -csr req.pem
```

Now a new certificate (in PEM format) has been generated and must be hosted at `https://jmcanterafonseca-iota.github.io/virtual-watch-tower/public/certs/vwt-1.crt` (or at the hosting site you own).

## Generate the credentials needed for compliance

In order to generate the Credentials needed for Compliance the `onboarding` tool is going to be used.

### Terms and Conditions (Self-signed)

The first credential to be generated is self-signed and it corresponds to the terms and conditions. For doing so a command line like the one below has to be executed:

Assuming the current working directory is `virtual-watch-tower`: 

```sh 
docker run -it -v ./identity-dataset:/ext --rm onboardingcli/onboardingcli vc create --claims-file /ext/claims/vwt-1-terms-conditions.json --template-file /ext/templates/template.json --subject-did-file /ext/identities/participants/vwt-1.json --trusted-issuer-file /ext/identities/participants/vwt-1.json --vc-version 2 --issuers-dir /ext/identities --templates-dir /ext/templates --vc-dir /ext/credentials
```

In essence, in order to generate a credential the Identity of the issuer, the Identity of the Subject (in this case are the same), the Credential template and the Credential's claims file have to be provided. You can observe that it is needed to map a volume of the Docker container into a local folder (`identity-dataset`) so that the Docker container can find the corresponding files.

After running the above command our first Credential will be available. You can observe that the Credential has been also encoded as JWT.

You can observe the claims of this credential [here](./identity-dataset/claims/vwt-1-terms-conditions.json).

### Legal Entity (Signed by TradeID)

This credential will contain the legal entity details of the participant. The issuer of this Credential is TradeID (a future onboarding platform under development by the TWIN Foundation). You can observe the claims of this credential [here](./identity-dataset/claims/vwt-1-legal-participant.json)

```sh 
docker run -it -v ./identity-dataset:/ext --rm onboardingcli/onboardingcli vc create --claims-file /ext/claims/vwt-1-legal-participant.json --template-file /ext/templates/template.json --subject-did-file /ext/identities/participants/vwt-1.json --trusted-issuer-file /ext/identities/tradeid.json --vc-version 2 --issuers-dir /ext/identities --templates-dir /ext/templates --vc-dir /ext/credentials
```

### Legal Registration Number (Signed by TWIN Notary)

Finally, the legal registration number credential attests what is the Legal Registration Number of the participant. This can be EORI number, Vat ID, LEI, etc. In this case it has been used as example the LEI Code of the RISE Institute. This Credential is signed by the TWIN Notary, a trusted service that bridges non-VC trust service providers, such as GLEIF to the VC data model and conventions. 

```sh
docker run -it -v ./identity-dataset:/ext --rm onboardingcli/onboardingcli vc create --claims-file /ext/claims/vwt-1-legal-registration-number.json --template-file /ext/templates/template.json --subject-did-file /ext/identities/participants/vwt-1.json --trusted-issuer-file /ext/identities/twin-notary.json --vc-version 2 --issuers-dir /ext/identities --templates-dir /ext/templates --vc-dir /ext/credentials
```

## Presenting the Credentials to the Clearing House for Checking Compliance

Now that the three needed Credentials are available they need to be presented to the Clearing House. The Clearing House (based on Gaia-X open source components) needs those credentials wrapped into a Verifiable Presentation signed by the holder (by our Participant). In order to generate such a VP is is needed to execute the following instruction:

```sh
docker run -it -v ./identity-dataset:/ext --rm onboardingcli/onboardingcli vp create --holder-identity-file /ext/identities/participants/vwt-1.json --vc-version 2 --vc-file /ext/credentials/vwt-1/vwt-1-legal-participant-credential.json --vc-file /ext/credentials/vwt-1/vwt-1-legal-registration-number-credential.json --vc-file /ext/credentials/vwt-1/vwt-1-terms-conditions-credential.json
```

Once the VP is available (as JWT) it has to be presented to the Clearing House through the following API call:

```sh
curl --location 'http://localhost:3005/api/credential-offers?vcid=https%3A%2F%2Fvwt-1.example.org%2Fcredentials%2Fcompliance-credential.json' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/jwt' \
--data 'eyJhbGciOiJFZERT...'
```

As a result a Compliance Credential, VC, will be issued, as follows.

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
    "https://w3id.org/gaia-x/development#"
  ],

    "gx:ComplianceCredential"
  ],

        "gx:integrityNormalization": "RFC8785:JCS",
        "gx:engineVersion": "2.2.0",
        "gx:rulesVersion": "PRLD-24.04_pre",
        "gx:originalType": "gx:LegalParticipant"
      },
      {
        "id": "https://jmcanterafonseca-iota.github.io/virtual-watch-tower/public/credentials/vwt-1/legalRegistrationNumberVC.json",
        "type": "gx:ComplianceEvidence",
        "gx:integrity": "sha256-965aba05a63148d04fdbc24aadef71b8df82d330cf4e39a831095da6c5e17b9c",
        "gx:integrityNormalization": "RFC8785:JCS",
        "gx:engineVersion": "2.2.0",
        "gx:rulesVersion": "PRLD-24.04_pre",
        "gx:originalType": "gx:legalRegistrationNumber"
      },
      {
        "id": "https://jmcanterafonseca-iota.github.io/virtual-watch-tower/public/credentials/vwt-1/termsAndConditionsVC.json",
        "type": "gx:ComplianceEvidence",
        "gx:integrity": "sha256-710442febb7e3897a1a79c65f5703905a097274f46ec0572be464b82a0a35ea0",
        "gx:integrityNormalization": "RFC8785:JCS",
        "gx:engineVersion": "2.2.0",
        "gx:rulesVersion": "PRLD-24.04_pre",
        "gx:originalType": "gx:GaiaXTermsAndConditions"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

 Such a Compliance Credential contains references (points to) the original Credentials that were issued formerly. That's why in order to enable the verification of this Compliance Credential it is needed to publish those Credentials following the steps below.

## Publication of the original Credentials

An optional step before the publication of the original Credentials is to add a JWS Signature to them, as the JSON-LD credential originally was not signed by the onboarding tool (we only have a JWT Credential signed). For doing so the following steps are needed:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jmcanterafonseca-iota/virtual-watch-tower
cd tools/jws-signer
npm install
npm run build
```

Afterwards it is needed to set up a `.env` file with the verification method of the signer and the private key. See example [here](./tools/jws-signer/env.example).

So for signing the terms and conditions credentials we will set a `.env` as follows:

```sh
VER_METHOD="did:iota:ebsi:0x74e4ac1abc064b3fea1feb08dde20220418c4abdb478738075b869100143e408#lYAEPQGdcH9crG0jqB_NcoYUYTnxU-BX1OI5PH3bHjw"
KEY_TYPE='EdDSA'
PRIVATE_KEY='-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MC4CAQAwBQYDK2VwBCIEINHeePH7mXYrNdWuM1v2E0HwbZZpS0BGQEZAVoSGo5Cj
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----'
```

Then for signing we will execute

```sh
node ./dist/signCredential.js ../../identity-dataset/credentials/vwt-1/vwt-1-terms-conditions-credential.json
```

The result will be the same credential in JSON-LD format but adding the corresponding proof as a JsonWeb2020 proof. Afterwards, the result (JSON-LD content) shall be copied to the corresponding hosting site, so that the Credential is available to be dereferenced through the Web. 

The same process shall be repeated with the legal entity credential and with the legal registration number credentials. However in those cases the `VER_METHOD` will be different so the `PRIVATE_KEY`. 

For the legal Participant credential the verification method shall be the one from TradeID. i.e. `did:web:iotaledger.github.io:ebsi-stardust-components:public:gaia-x:web:twin:tradeid#3gsxoxHO5KgTlR2jPWJyk4HOWpzlzYsHnUqYOEeNQO0` and the `KEY_TYPE` must be `RS256`.

For the legal Registration Number credential the verification method shall be the one from the TWIN Notary i.e. `did:web:iotaledger.github.io:ebsi-stardust-components:public:gaia-x:web:twin:notary#iwoi2hSS6sBeI7eimkgqyXyB1wEUFQ4oESTa7crdz_s` and the `KEY_TYPE` must be `RS256`.

And their respective private keys the ones found under the [pem-keys](./identity-dataset/pem-keys/) folder.

At the end of this process there shall be three different credentials hosted as it happens in our example at [./docs/public/credentials/vwt-1/](./docs/public/credentials/vwt-1/).

## Presenting the Compliance Credential to the Federated Catalogue Registry

The last step is to present the Compliance Credential (already obtained, see for example [vwt-1-compliance-credential.json](./identity-dataset/credentials/compliance/vwt-1-compliance-credential.json)) to the Federated Catalogue Registry. This component is being developed by the IOTA Foundation. The API REST call is as follows:

```sh
curl --location 'http://localhost:3020/fed-catalogue/participant-credentials' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/jwt' \
--data 'eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImlzcyI6ImRpZDp3ZWI6aW90YWxlZGdlci5naXRodWIuaW86ZWJzaS1zdGFyZHVzdC1jb21wb25lbnRzOnB1YmxpYzpnYWl...'
```

If the API call is successful then the new Participant will be on boarded and will appear among the known participants in the Federated Catalogue Registry. 

```sh
curl --location 'http://localhost:3020/fed-catalogue/participants?id=did%3Aiota%3Aebsi%3A0x74e4ac1abc064b3fea1feb08dde20220418c4abdb478738075b869100143e408'
```

will result in

```json
{
    "@context": [
        "https://w3id.org/gaia-x/development",
        "https://schema.org",
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2"
    ],
    "entities": [
        {
            "id": "did:iota:ebsi:0x74e4ac1abc064b3fea1feb08dde20220418c4abdb478738075b869100143e408",
            "type": "Participant",
            "lrnType": "LEI_CODE",
            "countryCode": "SE",
            "trustedIssuerId": "did:web:iotaledger.github.io:ebsi-stardust-components:public:gaia-x:web:twin:dch",
            "legalName": "Example Virtual Watch Tower 1",
            "validFrom": "2024-10-16T15:27:39.088Z",
            "validUntil": "2025-01-14T16:27:39.081Z",
            "dateCreated": "2024-10-17T07:43:22.175Z",
            "evidences": [
                "https://jmcanterafonseca-iota.github.io/virtual-watch-tower/public/credentials/vwt-1/legalParticipantVC.json",
                "https://jmcanterafonseca-iota.github.io/virtual-watch-tower/public/credentials/vwt-1/legalRegistrationNumberVC.json",
                "https://jmcanterafonseca-iota.github.io/virtual-watch-tower/public/credentials/vwt-1/termsAndConditionsVC.json"
            ]
        }
    ]
}```

## Registering the participant within a TLIP Node

Once a participant is known it has to be made known by a TLIP Node. Un this case we are creating a new login within a TLIP Node but instead of generating a new Identity, an existing Identity will be used.
